# EduTrack â€“ Student Management System

Developed a Student Management System using Java Swing, allowing users to manage student records (ID, Name, Grade).

The system features functionality for adding, editing, deleting, and searching student data, as well as saving and loading records from a CSV file for persistence.

The application provides a user-friendly interface with a table to display student data, a search bar to filter results, and a right-click context menu to edit or remove students.
